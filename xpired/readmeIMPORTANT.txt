IMPORTANT : snakemake 'Snake_qcmapcount.smk' did not work,
conflict among rules mapping_species1 (for STAR on species1)
and bspeciesmap (for STAR on species2) :
    it tryed to map species 2 on genome species 1, which is not desired !
Finally Snakemake error message suggested  "use wildcards constraints"
